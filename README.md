UniSQ Inter Campus Shuttle Bus Booking and Passenger Management project

## Getting Started

The project harnessed diverse technologies to achieve its objectives.
A vital component of the project technical approach is creation of mobile 
applications. Flutter, a cross-platform mobile development framework is utilized
 to create this mobile application.
This choice ensured a consistent user experience across all platforms while reducing development costs and time. 
Students and staff used a smartphone app as their main point of contact to reserve shuttle bus seats and access real-time route and schedule information.
The system primarily uses GPS and geolocation technology for real-time tracking and route data. 
GPS and geolocation APIs were efficiently linked to locating shuttle bus locations precisely, allowing passengers to track their buses in real-time via the mobile app. 
This technology not only enhanced the efficiency of shuttle bus management but also significantly improved the overall convenience for passengers. 
Integrating payment gateway services facilitated secure and convenient payment processing for shuttle bus reservations. 
Industry-standard payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe were incorporated to ensure the seamless handling of financial transactions within the mobile app. 
Users could make payments securely while safeguarding the confidentiality of their financial information.
